# SECOND VERSION OF PROJECT !

## Introduction

We decided to realize our CUDA project as Matrix Toolkit. Application allows you to:
  1. Addition of two matrices.
  2. Substraction of tow matrices.
  3. Matrix multiplication.
  4. Transpose matirx.
  5. Summation all elements of matrix/vector. 

More about used CUDA-specific techniques there are in FinalReport.pdf file.
Header files contain comments that serve as documentation of project. There are all information that you may need.

## How to run it

Most of all you have to have platform with CUDA device.

  1. Nextly download all files that Final_v2 folder contains.
  2. In Linux/Debian terminal go to Debug directory.
  3. Make sure that there are not any  .o and .d files.
  4. Use make command. If it does not work make sure that you have installed that utillity.
  5. Run your Final_v2 binary file and try the possibilities of the program.
